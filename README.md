# zOCdiac-Generator

This is a simple art prompt generator I made for my friends and me. 
It includes two boostrap files.

# How to install?
This script functions as a normal static website. You can upload it to any site that allows you to host custom html files (like Neocities or ComicFury)
Just create a new folder for the generator, download the files from this directory as ZIP, unpack it and upload to your server exactly as it is (files have to be in correct folders, otherwise it won't work).
After you're done uploading files, run index.html If it started generating prompts, it means you're all set!

# How to add my own characters/prompts/moods?
Head to your-generator-folder/static/js/generator.js and simply modify/replace them with your own data according to the key visible in the file. Don't forget about commas between them!

# How to customize my prompt generator?
Head to your-generator-folder/static/css/style.css, you can change everything in there. Feel free to use w3schools.com if you don't know how to code in CSS.
